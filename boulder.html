          <p>Boulder Class dragons are tough and associated with the earth. They can eat rocks, which many of them melt within their stomachs and regurgitate as lava blast.
            Although they have small wings compared to their body size, they are able to fly as fast and as high as most other dragons can.

                  <h3>Catastrophic Quaken</h3>
                  <p>	Catastrophic Quakens are known for their cruel attitudes. They don't let anyone get in their way, and they'll go out of their way to wreak havoc on their target.
                    Catastrophic Quakens eat more rocks than any other in their class! They also have a nasty habit of spitting up digested rocks at attackers in the form of hot lava!</p>

                  <div class="img-fix"></div>
                  <h3>Crimson Goregutter</h3>
                  <p>	Although Goregutters have impressive sets of antlers and axe-shaped tails, they are gentler than they appear and like to be left in peace. In battle, however, they have the ability to spew molten lava onto their antlers before ramming opponents with fiery force.</p>

                  <h3>Eruptodon</h3>
                  <p>Eruptodon's body temperature is directly linked to his experience. When his power peaks, his skin glows.
                    Though not a warrior, this dragon unleashes explosive violence when in dire straits. Nearly immune to heat damage, it is a vast force to be reckoned with.</p>

                  <h3>Grapple Grounder</h3>
                  <p>	This undisputed wrestling champion of the Boulder Class, it coils itself around victims and squeezes until they beg for mercy (but they never receive it!)
                    Grapple Grounders create beautiful waves in the sky while it shoots fireballs at its enemies.</p>

                  <h3>Groncicle</h3>
                  <p>	This arctic cousin of the Gronckle is cold blooded! With ice in his veins and liquid nitrogen fire, water actually freezes around him as he swims.
                    The Groncicle stays cool as ice in the toughest battles, freezing opponents with an exploding ice attack.</p>

                  <h3>Gonckle</h3>
                  <p>	This Dragon is not built for speed, but it can fly like a hummingbird. A giant, stubborn hummingbird that shoots lava rocks!
                    The Gronckle's tough hide can take more hits than almost any other Dragon...or any two Dragons combined!</p>
                </div>

                  <h3>Hotburple</h3>
                  <p>	The Hotburple can be a hot mess. Literally! A louder, fussier and lazier cousin to the Gronckle. A nap is never too far away.
                    The slow Hotburple is anything but lazy when it comes to battle. Opponents will have trouble getting out of its way!</p>
                </div>

                  <img src="./img/boulder-class/sentinel.webp" class="img" alt="sentinel">
                  <h3>Sentinel</h3>
                  <p>	Although sightless, the Sentinels still keep close watch over the dragon Graveyard on the Isle of Vanaheim.
                    These vast, stony Dragons show little room for weakness, but a clever mind can exploit their blindness. Be wary, however; they have a keen sense of smell.</p>

                <h3>Shovelhelm</h3>
                <p>Known as "Berk's Builders," Shovelhelms use their scooping chins to dig and their hard heads to hammer, making them very handy to have around!
                  Shovelhelms prefer to stand back and assess the situation. On Berk they find the problem and fix it. In battle they find the problem and take advantage!</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
                <img src="./img/boulder-class/snafflefang.webp" class="img" alt="gronckle">
                <h3>Snafflefang</h3>
                <p>Active and fastidious (for the Boulder Class), it has a soft spot for its favorite snack: geodes! Unfortunately, this makes it an easy target for trappers.
                  The Snafflefang is built tough enough to wade into battle and swing its spiked tail while blasting opponents with exploding fireballs.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
                <img src="./img/boulder-class/thunderpede.webp" class="img" alt="hotburple">
                <h3>Thunderpede</h3>
                <p>	The jackhammer-like forelegs of this ruthless bruiser can pulverize a massive boulder in seconds, and a Viking even faster!
                  If you hear the pitter-patter of dragon feet in battle, you'd better run; the Thunderpede is on its way!</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
                <img src="./img/boulder-class/whispering-death.webp" class="img" alt="sentinel">
                <h3>Whispering Death</h3>
                <p>Using its grinding teeth, this deadly Dragon burrows underground to attack from below. Very intelligent, with a long memory.
                  If the Whispering Death's rings of teeth and rock-hard exterior don't scare its opponents, breathing rings of fire will definitely do the trick!</p>
